YellowAPICocoa is a demonstration on how to get YellowAPI data with your App.

It uses YellowAPI (http://yellowapi.ca) with JSON-framework (https://github.com/stig/json-framework).

YellowAPICocoa captures the data from the JSON request and stores each result in an object (Locations).
Each of these are put in an array. From there, it's up to you what you want to do!
